= Introduction =

Since there is no installation file, capuchn needs to be installed by hand.

= Details =

   # Upload the files into a folder on your webserver,
   # If this installation is going to be run from a subdirectory, you will need to edit the "app/config/core.php" file. this has a BASE variable that must include your subdirectory path so, http://someurl/capuchn/ then set BASE to be "/capuchn/" and make sure to include the trailing slash. If a subdomain or domain, just leave this alone
   # Edit the "app/config/database.php" to the correct database information. This should be self explanitory, lookup cakephp if you have trouble (this is just a default cakephp database config file, nothing else special)
   # make sure that "app/webroot/img/pictures/" folder is writable by the webserver so that you can upload pictures
   # install the sql file that is in the root of the tgz file into your database, this should create all the tables you need. If you cannot do this, dont f with this, wait for an installer to come around, this is so alpha it makes your mother cry.
   # Edit the users in your database directly to edit your login info... yeah, this isnt even close to done.
   # Read up on cakephp and dojo if you want to do any development
   # Have fun!???!!
   # Profit?
