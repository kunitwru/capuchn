Widgets created for the Capuchn administration interface.


==CapuchnEditor==

The Capuchn editor extends the dijit.Editor to basically include the following features

  *Impliment resize
  *Single widget form - providing a single interface for data related to post 
  *Integrated save - no bouncing around the DOM to find the correct forms
  *Super simple initialization - a single div element will bring up the whole thing
  
Basically this can work as a stand-alone widget which may allow for wiki like page editing via a dialog.

==ImageDialog Plugin==

The image dialog plugin is intended to provide a simple way to add images from albums into a mag. Currently this has a thumbnail chooser wich will insert the thumbnail into the image. Once the image is selected, the diag can be brought up and values edited.
